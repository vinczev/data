The Swedish UD treebank is based on the Professional Prose section of Talbanken (Einarsson, 1976), originally annotated by a team led by Ulf Teleman at Lund University according to the MAMBA annotation scheme (Teleman, 1974). It consists of roughly 6,500 sentences and 100,000 tokens taken from a variety of genres, including text books, information brochures, and newspaper articles. The syntactic annotation is converted directly from the original MAMBA annotation, while the morphological annotation is based on the reannotation performed when incorporating Talbanken into the Swedish Treebank (Nivre and Megyesi, 2007). The new conversion, referred to as Talbanken15 (to distinguish it from the older conversions in Talbanken05 and Swedish Treebank), has been performed by Joakim Nivre and Aaron Smith at Uppsala University. We thank everyone who has been involved in previous conversion efforts at Växjö University and Uppsala University, including Bengt Dahlqvist, Sofia Gustafson-Capkova, Johan Hall, Anna Sågvall Hein, Beáta Megyesi, Jens Nilsson, and Filip Salomonsson.
